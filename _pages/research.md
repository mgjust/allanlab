# Research

I am a classically-trained ecologist who uses field experiments and quantitative methods to address both fundamental and applied ecological questions. My primary aim is to understand vegetation responses to stress and disturbance to predict vegetation responses to future environmental change. Within this broader context, much of my recent research has focused on tree responses to fire and urban stressors, two important factors that challenge our natural and planted forests as our global environment changes.
