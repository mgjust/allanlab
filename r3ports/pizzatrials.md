# Detroit-ish style pizza

## Reference recipes
1. [J. KENJI LÃ“PEZ-ALT - Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/02/detroit-style-pizza-recipe.html)
2. [Cook's Country](https://bit.ly/2VPwznq)

I basically used the recipe from Serious Eats and the technique from Cook's Country. But, I've made a few adjustments to fit my preferences. I've never had a real Detroit-style pizza... 

# Ingredients
## Dough
1. 270g AP flour
2. 200g water
3. 5g yeast
4. 6g salt

## Sauce
This makes more than you need for one pizza.

1. 28 oz can crushed tomoatoes
2. 2 T olive oil
3. 2 tsp dried oregano
4. 1 tsp garlic powder
5. 1 tsp onion powder
6. 1 tsp red wine vinegar
7. red pepper flakes and salt to taste
8. 2 tsp sugar

## Cheese
Read about it. I have used whatever. Usually mozzarella and cheddar, but have used jack and muenster. Sliced muenster make have worked the best. I don't put as much on as the recipes because I am eating all of this by myself usually. 

# Process
## Pan prep
1. Spray 9x13" nonstick baking pan with vegetable oil; then coat pan with 1-2 T olive oil

## Dough
Use a stand mixer with the dough hook. 

1. Combine flour and yeast on low speed until well combined
2. Leave the mixer running and slowly add water (not cold) and mix until dough forms about 1-2 minutes (scrape down bowl if needed). 
3. Cover mixing bowl and let stand for 10 minutes
4. Add salt and mix/knead on medium speed for 8 to 10 minutes (it will be sticky and will stick to the bottom of the bowl)
5. Transfer dough to prepared pan with oil spatula, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes. 
6. Use oiled or wet hands and press dough into corners of pan. (If you don't make it to corners easily, rest another 10 minutes, stretch again). 
7. Cover and let dough rise at room temperature for 2-3 hours or tripled in volume with medium-large bubbles
8. Move oven rack to lowest position; heat oven to 500 degrees.

## Sauce
1. Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and simmer.
2. Reduce until you like the thickness.

# Putting it all together
1. Parbake the pizza crust for 5 minutes at 500. I do this because I feel like the dough deflates too much otherwise and because I put the sauce on the dough.
2. Add toppings, sauce, cheese, etc. The first time I made it I put the sauce on top of the cheese. But now I put it beneath. Make sure cheese is on the edges of the pan.
3. Bake for 10-15 minues, or until cheese is bubbly and browned
4. Cool pizza in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes 
5. Use spatula to slide pizza onto cutting board

# Notes
Last time I made a sponge with 70g each flour and water and 4g yeast. I mixed this into the dough after about 6 hours, I think I liked this the best so far. Subtract sponge amounts from total. I often put the pan ontop of a heating pad if the dough is rising slowly.
